## Upgrading from Shahiem Seymor's Frontend User Roles Manager

If you have "Frontend User Roles Manager" installed there will be data transfer buttons
available in the "Passage Keys" list in the Back-end.  You may use them to transfer data from 
"Frontend User Roles Manager" to the "Passage Keys" plugin tables.

These buttons will go away if you uninstall "Frontend User Roles Manager".
